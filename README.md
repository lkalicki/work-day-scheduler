#Work Day Scheduler Challenge

Description

The Work Day Scheduler was created based on the mockup provided to allow for users to add events to their calendars based on specific times throughout the day, while also leveraging color-coding to indicate past, present, and future times. The current date and time is also displayed at the top of the screen. Local storage also helps store saved events at their respective times. Future enhancement suggestions include, but are not limited to drag and drop functionality, delete capabilities, and changing dates for future planning/expanding to a week/calendar view. A motivational message is also included in the footer.
